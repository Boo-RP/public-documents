## **KOS/RDM/VDM Rules** 

(Kill On Sight/Random Deathmatch/Vehicle Deathmatch)  
All of the offenses above are unacceptable in roleplay. Examples of them include killing/harming a player without proper roleplay initiation, or running people over with your vehicle. All of these are forbidden and are punishable. Punishments are up to the discretion of staff. 

*  RDM the act of killing a player with no reason and/or pretense. You can see why this is unfair and prohibited on our server.   
* VDM for ANY reason is strictly prohibited. Even in an RP interaction vehicles are NEVER to be used as a weapon, as there is very little to combat this and reduces roleplay.   
* If you are KOSed or Attempt KOSed then you should report or to staff in game, or make a ticket through discord with proof of said rule break.  
*  You are allowed to KOS people who are on your property after 2 verbal warnings and 2 in game warnings (Area chat).  
* The only types of “security” that are allowed to defend you are your own group or if you are an official gang your official allies. Official Security Companies are also able to protect you.  
* If you are damaged in an RP situation then you are only permitted to take revenge during that RP situation, if the player escapes or is arrested etc then you may not attempt to kill them.

## **NLR (New Life Rule)** {#nlr-(new-life-rule)}

NLR is when a player is killed, they are not allowed to continue their previous roleplay situation and/or return to the area involving their death. Information from the interaction where they died is lost. They may return to the area of death to grab your vehicle after the RP situation is clearly not still occurring and everyones moved on. 

*  If you have died, information you received from your past life does not carry over. Using excuses such as "I was watching from afar\!" and “I was on a call with him\! (Your old self)” are not RP and you will be banned for using that information.   
*  Once you have died DO NOT return to the situation for your items, or just to sit and watch as naked. This only causes unneeded confusion and staff situations.  
* If you are caught running back to areas involving your death, it will be breaking NLR.  
* A situation does not count as being "over" till everyone's dead or each party has clearly lost eyes on each other and gone separate ways. Attempting to involve yourself in ongoing situations to cause "new" ones will be NLR.  
*  Do not Interrupt scenes you were previously a part of. If you believe a rule was broken, request a staff member to deal with the situation after the RP has ended.  
*  Information such as screenshots or recordings may not be used as evidence or at all if you died before having a chance to upload them. (Having a chance to upload them is in short getting away from the scene with the evidence and not dying shortly afterwards.)

## **Property Rules**  {#property-rules}

* You cannot build killtraps in your property.  
* You may not free build inside your property to prevent it from being raided.   
* You are allowed up to 2 shops per player, and 2 houses per player.

**━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━**

## **Robberies** 

* To properly rob someone you must type in area chat “This is a robbery. You have 10 seconds to respond\!” and announce in voice chat if possible. A similar message that conveys your intent (and the 10-second limit) is also acceptable.  
* After committing a robbery you cannot hide in a locked area/property or log off for 10 minutes.  
* You must value your life in a robbery, do not just fight back if multiple people have weapons to your head (Fear RP)  
* You are only allowed to do a robbery once every hour. Official Gangs are able to rob up to 2 times per hour.  
* Killing the person you are robbing isn’t allowed unless the person you are robbing attempts to fight back. If they comply, you have to let them free.  
* Players being robbed cannot contact their local law enforcement (If applicable) during the robbery but can file a report after the robbery.  
* Players watching a robber are allowed to contact said local law enforcement if they're a safe distance away from the scene.  
* If you are being robbed and they do not follow these rules, please alert an admin with /report.

REMEMBER, robbers must initiate in AREA CHAT **AND** VOICE CHAT and must give the person they are robbing 10 seconds to give some kind of response. 

NO HEROES, meaning if you see someone getting robbed in area chat, Don’t Interfere. Stay away and hope the victim makes it out alive so you can help them. Unless you directly see the crime and the person is a group member, you can’t try to be a hero. (Fear RP)

Remember, Boo is an all-consent roleplay server. Everyone has the right to leave a roleplay scene if they don’t want to partake in it. [Read more\!](#misc)

##     **Raiding**

Raiding is the act of invasion by a group authorized to do raids, such as Boo Rangers. If the raiding group is not authorized by a Senior Administrator or above, then it will be considered [griefing](#heading=h.1v0qyzk84q2i).  
During a raid, all parties are expected to follow [NLR](#nlr-\(new-life-rule\)), [Property Rules](#property-rules), [Fear RP](#fear-roleplay), [Fail RP](#fail-roleplay-\(frp\)), etc. (**ALWAYS** follow every rule, but these are the one’s most relevant to raids.)  
All raids must be approved by a Senior Moderator or above, if not, it will be considered [griefing](#heading=h.1v0qyzk84q2i).  
If any of the rules mentioned above are broken, the raid is to be halted immediately and punishment is to be handed out to the offending players.

Reminder: Boo Roleplay is an ALL-CONSENT roleplay server, as raiding is considered a roleplay event, both parties reserve the right to end the interaction.

## **Griefing**

Griefing is when a player purposefully interferes/ruins the experience of other players, [intent to impose grief upon someone](https://www.reddit.com/r/playark/comments/3czra1/comment/ct0hnk9/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  
This includes

- Destroying bases or builds without permission from an Administrator or above.  
- Stealing items outside of an RP scenario.  
- Ruining the roleplay experience for anyone.  
- Being annoying.

Griefing is a very complicated subject, so punishments are left to the discretion of staff.

## **Fail Roleplay (FRP)** {#fail-roleplay-(frp)}

* There are many scenarios which can count as Fail RP, some of them are listed below:   
- Players cannot wiggle or break out of cuffs during RP  
- Players cannot jump out of moving vehicles  
- Players without diving gear can’t swim for long distances. While crossing a river at a narrow point can be fine, going to the ocean and swimming to an island, carrier etc is not allowed.  
- Players cannot use Kits or Warps while RPing  
- Owning a business or holding a server job without handling that business/job requirement can be considered FailRP. For example, a store owner who constantly self-restocks items and doesn’t sell to civilians.

## **Fear Roleplay** {#fear-roleplay}

Fear Roleplay is the concept that all characters must fear death as they would in real life. 

*  Some examples of breaking FearRP:   
  *  Pulling weapons when two or more people are pointing weapons straight at you	  
  *  Involving yourself intentionally into dangerous situations that could harm you or other people. (e.g. volunteering as a hostage. Defending those not in your in-game group)  
*  This also applies to other people's lives\! You must fear for other players lives to a similar degree as your own

**━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━**

## **Kit Rules**

*   You must not give away items from kits which are not accessible to everyone on the server.   
*  You should not intentionally drop items from your kits in public areas.   
*   You cannot sell items from any of your kits. 

**━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━**

## **Common Sense**

We ask all players to use common sense on our server, staff members reserve the right to punish players whose behavior is deemed inappropriate or offensive, if you have to ask if something is against the rules then it most likely is. Please think about what you do in your RP situations before acting them out.

**━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━**

## **Misc**  {#misc}

*  You cannot steal any vehicles no matter what.   
*  Do not bait the Military, simple as that.   
*  Do not bait people into Kos/Breaking Rules.  
*  Do not scam people, common sense.  
* Corruption or abuse is not allowed at all, if you see something, report it.  
* Boo Roleplay is an all-party consent roleplay server. If anyone in an RP scene no longer wants to be a part of it, they have a right to leave without repercussions. Exceptions include the following  
  * Active punishment by authorized RP groups (e.g. Boo Rangers)
